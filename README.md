# Detect Lane Lines with Python & OpenCV

[Final out put video](https://youtu.be/KqUhB3i5WF0)

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- MoviePy
- matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Numpy

## For review
`P1.ipynb`: the notebook contains all the codes to extract final output video as above. The implemented helping methods are grayscale converter, canny threshold, gaussian blur, extract region of interest and drawing lane line by using the average slope of detected lane lines.

The video and are image are used to test in the notebook are not provided with the notebook. If wanting to test on personal image or video, please pay attention to the size setting of image/video, and region of interest ratio.
